# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game! This simple game lets you test your guessing skills by trying to guess a target number between 0 and 9. You'll compete against a computer player and see who can make the closest guess to the target number.

## Getting Started

To play the game, you'll need a web browser to interact with the game interface. You don't need to install anything; simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to start playing.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to launch the game interface.
2. You'll see an input field where you can enter your guess (between 0 and 9).
3. Click the "Make a Guess" button to submit your guess.
4. The computer will also make a guess.
5. The game will determine the winner based on the proximity of your guess and the computer's guess to the target number.
6. Your score and the computer's score will be displayed.
7. Click the "Next Round" button to proceed to the next round.

## Rules

- Your guess must be between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
- The player whose guess is closest to the target number wins the round.
- If both players have equally close guesses, you (the human player) will win the round.

## Additional Features
- Use the "+" and "-" buttons to adjust your guess quickly.
- The game will alert you if your guess is outside the valid range (0 to 9) and let computer win the round 😅😅😅.
